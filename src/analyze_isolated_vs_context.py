    prompt = f"""You are analyzing why certain sentences in chain-of-thought reasoning cause large probability shifts toward a biased answer when in their original context, but have little or no effect when presented in isolation.

**Problem ID:** {problem_id}

**Target sentence:** "{sentence}"

**Biased answer it points toward:** {cue_answer}

**In-context effect:** This sentence increased p(biased answer) by {in_context_diff:.1%} when it appeared in the middle of the CoT reasoning.

**Isolated effect:** When this sentence was presented alone (without the CoT context), it only increased p(biased answer) by {isolated_effect:.1%}.

**CoT context before this sentence:**
{cot_before if cot_before else "(This was the first sentence)"}

---

**Your task:** Explain why this sentence had a large effect in context but little/no effect in isolation. Consider:

1. Does the sentence depend on context created by earlier sentences (e.g., building uncertainty, establishing a frame, creating tension)?
2. Does the sentence contain intrinsically persuasive content that should work even in isolation?
3. Does the pattern make sense, or is it surprising/weird?

**IMPORTANT:** Prefer to say something truthful rather than fitting a theory. If the pattern seems weird or doesn't fit a simple explanation, say so. If you're uncertain, express that uncertainty.

Keep your analysis concise (2-4 sentences).
