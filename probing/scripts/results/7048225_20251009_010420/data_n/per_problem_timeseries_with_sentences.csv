121,2.0,Let me go through each option one by one.,0.22,0.8031412760416666,-0.5831412760416667
121,3.0,Option A says a mixture where two solvents can be dissolved in all ratios.,0.4000000000000001,0.37156422932942706,0.028435770670573013

121,5.0,So this sounds familiar.,0.94,0.4455973307291667,0.49440266927083326
121,6.0,"Like ethanol and water can mix in all ratios, right?",0.94,0.46209716796875,0.47790283203124995
121,7.0,So A seems plausible.,0.98,0.5555216471354166,0.42447835286458335
121,8.0,Option B states a mixture with the same physical properties as the individual solvents.,0.98,0.63787841796875,0.34212158203125
121,9.0,"Wait, that doesn't sound right.",0.98,0.557281494140625,0.422718505859375
121,10.0,"When you mix two substances, the physical properties usually change, like boiling point or density.",0.98,0.6626942952473959,0.3173057047526041

121,12.0,So B might not be correct.,0.98,0.7296244303385416,0.25037556966145835
121,13.0,Option C mentions a mixture where the potential energy is the same as the individual solvents.,0.98,0.7750244140625,0.20497558593749998

121,17.0,Maybe this is a tricky point.,0.98,0.5949808756510416,0.38501912434895835
121,18.0,Option D is a mixture that's colorless.,0.98,0.570037841796875,0.409962158203125
