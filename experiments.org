* Brownian motion baseline

Hypothesis: The probability time series we observe might just be conditioned Brownian motion.

We simulate Brownian bridge conditioned on:
- Starting at B_0 ~ Unif(0, 0.5)
- Ending at B_T = 1
- Staying in [0, 1] at all times

Then we look at the distribution of X_t = B_t - B_{t-1} to see if it matches our CoT probability differences.
