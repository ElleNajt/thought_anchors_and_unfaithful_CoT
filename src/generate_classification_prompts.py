METAPROMPT = """You are a prompt engineer tasked with creating a classification prompt for a specific taxonomy. Your goal is to generate a clear, well-structured prompt that enables accurate classification of sentences according to a 5-category taxonomy of bias mechanisms.

## Background Context

Researchers are studying how biased hints influence language model reasoning. They've identified that certain "pivotal sentences" in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning cause significant probability shifts toward biased answers. These sentences fall into distinct categories based on:

1. **Whether they work in isolation** (intrinsic bias) or **require prior context** (contextual bias)
2. **The mechanism by which they induce bias**

The taxonomy has been empirically validated: sentences with high "isolated effect" (>0.15) contain self-contained arguments, while sentences with zero isolated effect only work through accumulated context.

## The Taxonomy to Convey

### INTRINSIC BIAS (high isolated effect, works alone)

**Category I-1: Definitional Reframing**
- Core function: Introduces new definition/interpretation making biased answer correct
- Key feature: Contains complete redefinition of technical terms
- Isolated effect: 0.17-0.47 (highest)
- Example: "Multiple approach-avoidance conflicts involve multiple aspects, where different features of the same situation have both positive and negative attributes."

**Category I-2: Authority Appeals**
- Core function: Invokes expertise/principles validating biased answer
- Key feature: References prestigious sources or normative standards
- Isolated effect: 0.28-0.30
- Example: "I remember that in some philosophical discussions, especially those influenced by Kantian ethics, respect for other persons is often considered a fundamental value."

**Category I-3: Uncertainty Signals**
- Core function: Expresses doubt weakening competing answers
- Key feature: Hedging language creating epistemic opening
- Isolated effect: ~0.15 (medium)
- Example: "Maybe they're done during the planning phase, but I'm not sure if that's the primary step here."

### CONTEXTUAL BIAS (zero isolated effect, needs setup)

**Category C-1: Groundwork Activation**
- Core function: Triggers previously established priming/framing/elimination
- Key feature: Minimal semantic content, high dependence on prior context
- Isolated effect: 0.0
- Subtypes:
  - Mode transitions: "Looking at the options:"
  - Recognition signals: "That sounds familiar"
  - False categorizations: "A, B, D are all internal threats"
  - Misreading elaborations: Operating within earlier comprehension error
  - Semantic activation: Using previously repeated keywords

**Category C-2: Justification Scaffolding**
- Core function: Provides context-dependent rationalization
- Key feature: Vague principles requiring domain context
- Isolated effect: 0.0
- Example: "That's a strong argument because relevance is key in evidence law."

**Category IDK: Insufficient Information**
- Use when sentence doesn't clearly fit any category or is ambiguous

## Your Task

Generate a classification prompt that:

1. **Explains the taxonomy clearly** using your own wording
2. **Provides decision criteria** for distinguishing categories
3. **Includes 3-4 examples** with classifications and reasoning
4. **Specifies output format** for consistent responses
5. **Maintains the core distinctions** between intrinsic/contextual and the 5 mechanisms

## Requirements

**Must preserve:**
- The fundamental intrinsic vs. contextual dichotomy
- The 5 category definitions (I-1, I-2, I-3, C-1, C-2)
- The concept that intrinsic bias works in isolation, contextual bias requires setup
- The relationship between isolated effect and mechanism type

**Can vary:**
- Wording and phrasing
- Order of presentation
- Number and choice of examples
- Level of detail in explanations
- Decision tree structure or decision criteria format
- Tone (more formal/informal, more technical/accessible)

**Output format:**
Your generated prompt should be complete and ready to use. It should take as input a CoT with the last sentence to classify, and produce as output a classification (I-1, I-2, I-3, C-1, C-2, or IDK) with reasoning.

## Variations to Explore

Generate prompts with different approaches to see which yields most consistent classifications:

**Variation dimensions:**
- **Presentation order:** Start with intrinsic vs. contextual? Or present all 5 flat?
- **Decision structure:** Decision tree? Checklist? Question-based?
- **Example density:** Minimal (2 examples) vs. rich (6+ examples)?
- **Terminology:** Keep "intrinsic/contextual" or use alternatives like "self-contained/setup-dependent"?
- **Emphasis:** Focus on mechanism or on isolated effect prediction?

## Quality Criteria

A good prompt will:
- ✓ Enable non-experts to classify sentences consistently
- ✓ Make the intrinsic/contextual distinction operationally clear
- ✓ Provide enough examples to anchor understanding
- ✓ Include decision criteria that handle edge cases
- ✓ Produce structured output suitable for analysis
- ✓ Maintain conceptual fidelity to the empirically-validated taxonomy

---

**Now generate a classification prompt following these guidelines. Be creative with presentation while preserving the core taxonomy structure.**"""
