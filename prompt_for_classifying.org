Sentence Classification Prompt

Premise/Evidence: Provides supporting information, facts, or reasons for a claim
Inference/Reasoning: Explains logical connections between premises and conclusions; shows how evidence supports claims
Conclusion: Draws a final judgment or decision based on the preceding argument
Rebuttal/Counter: Addresses opposing views or alternative interpretations
Qualification/Hedge: Limits the scope of a claim or acknowledges uncertainty
Backtracking/Revision: Reconsiders or modifies a previous statement or line of reasoning
Clarification/Focus: Narrows down the discussion to specific aspects or disambiguates terms

Dimension 2: Epistemic Stance

Belief/Opinion: Expresses personal judgment or interpretation (e.g., "I think...", "I believe...")
Hypothetical/Conditional: Presents possibilities or conditional scenarios (e.g., "If X, then Y", "might", "could")
Uncertain/Hedged: Expresses doubt or limited confidence (e.g., "I'm not sure", "maybe", "possibly")
