119,15.0,Extinction is a behavioral principle where a response decreases because it's no longer reinforced.,1.0,1.0,0.0
119,16.0,Catharsis isn't exactly about extinguishing emotions but about expressing them.,1.0,0.9997456868489584,0.00025431315104162966

121,3.0,Option A says a mixture where two solvents can be dissolved in all ratios.,0.4000000000000001,0.37156422932942706,0.028435770670573013

121,5.0,So this sounds familiar.,0.94,0.4455973307291667,0.49440266927083326
121,6.0,"Like ethanol and water can mix in all ratios, right?",0.94,0.46209716796875,0.47790283203124995
121,7.0,So A seems plausible.,0.98,0.5555216471354166,0.42447835286458335
121,8.0,Option B states a mixture with the same physical properties as the individual solvents.,0.98,0.63787841796875,0.34212158203125
121,9.0,"Wait, that doesn't sound right.",0.98,0.557281494140625,0.422718505859375

121,13.0,Option C mentions a mixture where the potential energy is the same as the individual solvents.,0.98,0.7750244140625,0.20497558593749998
121,14.0,I'm not too sure about this.,0.98,0.58831787109375,0.39168212890625

121,17.0,Maybe this is a tricky point.,0.98,0.5949808756510416,0.38501912434895835
121,18.0,Option D is a mixture that's colorless.,0.98,0.570037841796875,0.409962158203125
121,19.0,"Color has more to do with the molecules absorbing certain wavelengths, but ideal solutions aren't necessarily colorless.",0.98,0.4677581787109375,0.5122418212890625
121,20.0,Some solutions might have color regardless of being ideal.,0.98,0.46746826171875,0.51253173828125

375,8.0,That feels relevant.,1.0,1.0,0.0
375,9.0,Option C mentions reconciling conflicting moral theories.,1.0,1.0,0.0
375,10.0,That's a bit abstract and might be more about theoretical discussions rather than a practical paralysis.,1.0,1.0,0.0
375,11.0,Option D refers to giving up wealth based on Singer's arguments.,1.0,1.0,0.0
375,12.0,"Singer's utilitarian views are about giving as much as possible, but I'm not sure if that's the main issue Ashford is addressing.",1.0,1.0,0.0

399,4.0,"People with these traits might struggle with learning, especially if learning environments are structured in ways that require cooperation, empathy, or adherence to rules.",0.64,0.7596435546875,-0.11964355468749999
399,5.0,Looking at the options:,0.7200000000000001,0.414947509765625,0.3050524902343751
399,6.0,A) Social ostracism: This is being excluded or ignored by others.,0.52,0.5721232096354166,-0.05212320963541661
399,7.0,Antisocial individuals might already feel detached or distrustful.,0.86,0.6482289632161459,0.21177103678385412

399,12.0,"But antisocial traits might not stem from such issues, so the effect might be limited.",0.96,0.7615814208984375,0.19841857910156246
399,13.0,"D) Physical punishment: This could lead to fear or resentment, which might actually increase antisocial behaviors rather than improve learning.",0.98,0.7555338541666666,0.22446614583333335
408,0.0,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these statements about the consequences of an adaptive metabolic demand on protein requirements is correct.",0.46,0.4599609375,3.9062500000019984e-05
408,1.0,"I remember from my studies that nitrogen balance studies are used to determine protein requirements, but I'm a bit fuzzy on how adaptation plays into this.",0.34,0.34033203125,-0.0003320312499999756
408,2.0,"First, let's break down each option:",0.48,0.47998046875,1.9531249999982236e-05
408,3.0,Option A says adaptation is fully accounted for in nitrogen balance studies.,0.42,0.419921875,7.812499999998446e-05
408,4.0,I don't think that's right.,0.3469387755102041,0.346923828125,1.4947385204078234e-05
408,5.0,"Adaptation can vary between individuals and situations, and I don't recall studies fully accounting for all possible adaptations.",0.36000000000000004,0.360107421875,-0.00010742187499995781
408,6.0,Option B claims that adaptive metabolic demand means the slope of N-balance studies underestimates protein efficiency.,0.48,0.47998046875,1.9531249999982236e-05
408,7.0,I'm not too sure about this.,0.54,0.53955078125,0.00044921875000003553
408,8.0,"The slope in N-balance studies usually reflects how much nitrogen is retained, but I'm not certain if adaptation would make this less efficient.",0.7200000000000001,0.72021484375,-0.00021484374999991562
408,9.0,Option C suggests variable adaptation between studies is accounted for by using EAR+2SD.,0.56,0.56005859375,-5.859374999994671e-05
408,10.0,That sounds familiar.,0.98,0.97998046875,1.9531249999982236e-05
408,11.0,"EAR is the Estimated Average Requirement, and 2SD accounts for variability.",0.98,0.97998046875,1.9531249999982236e-05
408,12.0,So maybe this is correct because it includes a buffer for different adaptations.,0.98,0.98046875,-0.00046875000000001776
408,13.0,Option D says adaptation shouldn't influence N-balance interpretations.,0.98,0.97998046875,1.9531249999982236e-05
408,14.0,"That doesn't make sense because adaptation definitely affects how much protein is needed, so it must play a role.",0.98,0.97998046875,1.9531249999982236e-05
684,0.0,"Okay, so I have this question about what a sect is organized around, and I need to figure out the correct answer.",0.66,0.66015625,-0.00015624999999996891
684,1.0,"The options are A, B, C, D.",0.54,0.5400390625,-3.906249999996447e-05
684,2.0,Let me try to break this down.,0.6,0.60009765625,-9.76562500000222e-05
684,3.0,"First, I remember that a sect is a subgroup or a smaller organization within a larger religious or ideological group.",0.54,0.5400390625,-3.906249999996447e-05
684,4.0,They often have distinct beliefs and practices.,0.58,0.580078125,-7.812500000003997e-05
684,5.0,"Now, looking at the answer choices:",0.7200000000000001,0.72021484375,-0.00021484374999991562
684,6.0,"Option A says a sect is organized around beliefs that can be challenged by members, a charismatic leader, and openness to new recruits.",0.86,0.85986328125,0.00013671874999998668
684,7.0,That sounds plausible because I think sects often have strong leaders and are open to attracting more people.,0.9,0.8994140625,0.0005859375000000222
684,8.0,"Also, if members can challenge beliefs, it might mean the group is dynamic.",0.98,0.97998046875,1.9531249999982236e-05
684,9.0,Option B mentions tolerance towards other religions and separation of church and state.,0.98,0.97998046875,1.9531249999982236e-05
684,10.0,"That seems more like characteristics of a broader religious organization, maybe a denomination, rather than a sect.",0.98,0.97998046875,1.9531249999982236e-05
684,11.0,Sects are usually more insular and might not be as tolerant.,0.98,0.97998046875,1.9531249999982236e-05
684,12.0,"Option C talks about voluntary membership, democratic leadership, and high emotional commitment.",0.98,0.98046875,-0.00046875000000001776
684,13.0,Voluntary membership makes sense because people join sects willingly.,0.98,0.97998046875,1.9531249999982236e-05
684,14.0,But democratic leadership doesn't quite fit because sects are often led by a single charismatic figure rather than a group.,0.98,0.97998046875,1.9531249999982236e-05
684,15.0,So maybe C isn't the best choice.,0.98,0.97998046875,1.9531249999982236e-05
684,16.0,Option D refers to the idea of the secular world as sacred.,0.98,0.9794921875,0.0005078124999999822
684,17.0,That sounds more like a philosophical perspective rather than something a sect is organized around.,0.98,0.97998046875,1.9531249999982236e-05
684,18.0,"Sects are typically focused on their own beliefs, not necessarily on the secular world.",0.98,0.97998046875,1.9531249999982236e-05
684,19.0,"So putting it together, A seems the best fit.",0.98,0.97998046875,1.9531249999982236e-05
700,0.0,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best answer to this question.",0.26,0.260009765625,-9.765624999991118e-06

700,2.0,A man is charged with tax fraud and wants to use evidence of his honesty from when he ran for mayor.,0.28,0.280029296875,-2.9296874999973355e-05
700,3.0,"During his campaign, he refused to lie about a psychiatric problem, which cost him the election.",0.38000000000000006,0.3798828125,0.00011718750000005995
700,4.0,"He said, ""If I lied, I'd be mayor today, but that's no way to win an election.""",0.32,0.320068359375,-6.835937499999334e-05
700,5.0,The question is asking what the best argument of the objector (the person opposing this evidence) would be.,0.14,0.14013671875,-0.00013671874999998668
700,6.0,The options are (A) through (D).,0.24,0.239990234375,9.765624999991118e-06
700,7.0,"First, I need to recall the rules about character evidence in criminal trials.",0.26,0.259521484375,0.0004785156250000089
700,8.0,"From what I remember, in criminal cases, a defendant can sometimes offer evidence of their good character to show that they're less likely to commit a crime.",0.32,0.320068359375,-6.835937499999334e-05
700,9.0,But there are rules about how this can be done.,0.12,0.1201171875,-0.00011718750000000444
700,10.0,Option A says character evidence isn't admissible.,0.26,0.260009765625,-9.765624999991118e-06
700,11.0,"But I think that's not entirely true because the defendant can introduce evidence of good character, especially under Federal Rule of Evidence 405(a), which allows for specific instances of conduct.",0.16,0.16015625,-0.00015624999999999667
700,12.0,So A might not be the best argument.,0.18000000000000002,0.1806640625,-0.0006640624999999789
700,13.0,Option B says one incident doesn't prove character.,0.42,0.419921875,7.812499999998446e-05
700,14.0,"That makes sense because a single act, even if it shows honesty, doesn't establish a consistent character.",0.24,0.239990234375,9.765624999991118e-06
700,15.0,But I'm not sure if this is the strongest argument here.,0.62,0.6201171875,-0.00011718750000000444
700,16.0,Option C says it's an impermissible way to prove character.,0.62,0.61962890625,0.00037109374999999556
700,17.0,I'm a bit confused about this.,0.46,0.4599609375,3.9062500000019984e-05
700,18.0,"If the man is offering his past conduct as evidence of his good character, that should be permissible under the rules.",0.38000000000000006,0.3798828125,0.00011718750000005995
700,19.0,So maybe C isn't the right choice.,0.6,0.60009765625,-9.76562500000222e-05
700,20.0,Option D says the evidence is irrelevant.,0.38000000000000006,0.3798828125,0.00011718750000005995
700,21.0,That's a strong argument because relevance is key in evidence law.,0.9,0.89990234375,9.76562500000222e-05
700,22.0,"If the evidence doesn't connect to the crime charged, it's irrelevant.",0.92,0.919921875,7.812500000003997e-05

715,3.0,Let me break it down.,0.0,0.0,0.0
715,4.0,"First, productive resources usually refer to things like labor, capital, and land that contribute to producing goods and services.",0.02,0.02001953125,-1.9531249999999584e-05
715,5.0,"So, (A) all productive resources seems too broad because land isn't the only productive resource.",0.0,0.0,0.0
715,6.0,It's just one part of it.,0.0,0.0,0.0
715,7.0,"Next, (B) all natural resources.",0.02,0.01953125,0.0004687500000000004
715,8.0,"Natural resources include things like minerals, forests, water, etc.",0.02,0.02001953125,-1.9531249999999584e-05
715,9.0,"Land is definitely a natural resource, but does it encompass all of them?",0.0,0.0,0.0
715,10.0,"I think land specifically refers to the physical surface of the earth, not necessarily all natural resources.",0.0,0.0,0.0
715,11.0,"So, (B) might be too inclusive.",0.0,0.0,0.0
715,12.0,Option (C) is farmland only.,0.0,0.00048828125,-0.00048828125
715,13.0,That doesn't sound right because land includes more than just areas used for farming.,0.02,0.02001953125,-1.9531249999999584e-05
715,14.0,"It's about the entire surface, including urban areas, forests, etc.",0.0,0.0,0.0
715,15.0,Then there's (D) real estate.,0.04,0.0400390625,-3.906249999999917e-05
715,16.0,"Real estate involves land and the buildings on it, like houses and commercial properties.",0.02,0.01953125,0.0004687500000000004
715,17.0,But does land refer exclusively to real estate?,0.06,0.06005859375,-5.859375000000222e-05
715,18.0,I don't think so because land can be unused or just the surface without any structures.,0.0,0.0,0.0
715,19.0,"Wait, maybe I should think about the economic definition.",0.0,0.0,0.0
715,20.0,"In economics, land is considered a factor of production, specifically the natural resources that are used to produce goods.",0.04,0.0400390625,-3.906249999999917e-05
715,21.0,"But in common language, when someone refers to land, they often mean the physical surface, including real estate.",0.7600000000000001,0.759765625,0.0002343750000001199
715,22.0,"But in some contexts, like in real estate terms, land is just the property without the buildings.",0.7399999999999999,0.740234375,-0.0002343750000001199
768,0.0,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this accounting question.",0.22,0.219970703125,2.929687500000111e-05

768,5.0,But what exactly does the accountant need to do before starting this process?,0.32,0.320068359375,-6.835937499999334e-05
768,6.0,Option A says the accountant must verify that the financial information agrees with the books of original entry.,0.4000000000000001,0.39990234375,9.765625000007772e-05
768,7.0,"That sounds like part of the verification process, maybe during the audit or review, but I'm not sure if it's the first step before compiling.",0.34,0.3398081461588542,0.00019185384114583925
768,8.0,It feels more like a step during the compilation rather than prior to it.,0.24,0.239990234375,9.765624999991118e-06
768,9.0,Option B mentions performing preliminary analytical procedures to identify specific risks.,0.18000000000000002,0.18017578125,-0.0001757812499999789

768,11.0,"Maybe they're done during the planning phase, but I'm not sure if that's the primary step here.",0.7799999999999999,0.77978515625,0.00021484374999991562
768,12.0,Option C talks about making inquiries of management about their procedures for adjusting and closing the books.,0.7200000000000001,0.720703125,-0.0007031249999999156
768,13.0,This makes sense because understanding how the entity handles its book-closing process is crucial.,0.86,0.85986328125,0.00013671874999998668
768,14.0,"If the accountant knows how management adjusts entries and closes the books, they can better compile the financial statements accurately.",0.88,0.8798828125,0.00011718750000000444

804,8.0,B) Banned race-based discrimination: This sounds plausible because the Act was designed to eliminate racial discrimination in voting.,0.86,0.7534993489583334,0.10650065104166662

877,2.0,The situation is that a state law currently requires vacant public school buildings to be sold at auction to the highest bidder.,0.16,0.1600341796875,-3.417968749999667e-05

877,7.0,One thing that comes to mind is the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.,0.48,0.4794921875,0.0005078124999999822

877,21.0,Option D says it's okay because the law doesn't primarily support the church's religious activities.,0.46,0.4599609375,3.9062500000019984e-05
