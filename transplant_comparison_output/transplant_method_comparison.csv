Option A says a sect is organized around beliefs that can be challenged by members, a charismatic leader, and openness to new recruits.",0.564,0.9644,0.998,0.4004,0.434
684,A,C,6,0.35,That sounds plausible because I think sects often have strong leaders and are open to attracting more people.,0.564,0.9956,0.9976,0.4316,0.4336
684,A,C,7,0.4,"Also, if members can challenge beliefs, it might mean the group is dynamic.",0.564,0.9966,0.9775,0.4326,0.4136
