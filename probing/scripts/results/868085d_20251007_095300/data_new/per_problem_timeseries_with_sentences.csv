700,5.0,The question is asking what the best argument of the objector (the person opposing this evidence) would be.,0.14,0.3379313151041667,-0.19793131510416667
700,6.0,The options are (A) through (D).,0.24,0.5356699625651041,-0.29566996256510414

700,9.0,But there are rules about how this can be done.,0.12,0.772552490234375,-0.652552490234375
700,10.0,Option A says character evidence isn't admissible.,0.26,0.7646687825520834,-0.5046687825520834

700,12.0,So A might not be the best argument.,0.18000000000000002,0.947265625,-0.767265625
700,13.0,Option B says one incident doesn't prove character.,0.42,0.9017842610677084,-0.4817842610677084
700,14.0,"That makes sense because a single act, even if it shows honesty, doesn't establish a consistent character.",0.24,0.8889872233072916,-0.6489872233072916
700,15.0,But I'm not sure if this is the strongest argument here.,0.62,0.8357645670572916,-0.21576456705729163
700,16.0,Option C says it's an impermissible way to prove character.,0.62,0.8470458984375,-0.2270458984375
700,17.0,I'm a bit confused about this.,0.46,0.7682698567708334,-0.30826985677083335
